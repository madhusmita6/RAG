Fulfillment Manager,"COMPANY OVERVIEW Started 50 years ago by the National Wildlife Federation, Garden for Wildlife™ aims to revolutionize the way people plant, so that—together—we can reverse a declining trend among important backyard wildlife species (think butterflies, birds, bees, and more). It sounds like a lofty goal but it’s actually very doable. The key is to get people to turn their own small piece of Earth—porches, balconies, yards, and gardens—into thriving wildlife habitats by planting native plants. Unfortunately, this solution isn’t well-known and native plants aren’t always easy to find. Insert lightbulb emoji… We work with expert gardeners and scientists to identify the plants that help the highest numbers of wildlife species and we partner with sustainable growers around the country to provide those plants. In spring 2021, we began selling these native plants on our website, GardenforWildlife.com, and we ship directly to our customers’ doorstep in 36 states. Ultimately, we make it easier than ever for anyone—whether a first-timer or the greenest of thumbs—to garden for wildlife and make a real impact. With two gardening seasons under our belt, we’ve empowered and enabled people to create more than 450,000 square feet of new wildlife habitat. And we’re still growing (no pun intended, though we admittedly find these puns hard to avoid)! This year, we’re introducing a one-to-one business model where for every plant sold, we will donate a plant to a community garden or public space—doubling our collective impact and bringing the joy and beauty of nature to even more people.
